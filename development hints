# hints for Saad
We need to divide the software to be like monitoring component calling evacuation component
We need to decide we will process host by host or all hosts at once ?
Do we need to use threading ??

After adding the notification driver, we can handle the failed nodes by triggering the driver to send notification directly to the admin ...
